 Biography 

Nwaubani was born in Enugu, Nigeria, to Chief Chukwuma Hope Nwaubani and Dame Patricia Uberife Nwaubani on 28 March 1976. Nwaubani was raised by both parents in her hometown Umuahia, Abia State, among the Igbo people. Her family is descended from members of the Nigerian chieftaincy system; her great-grandfather Chief Nwaubani Ogogo Oriaku – the source of her surname – was a famous chief and a trader licensed by the Royal Niger Company in the late 19th century. His goods included slaves.

At the age of 10, she left home to attend boarding school at the Federal Government Girls College Owerri. She studied Psychology at the University of Ibadan, Nigeria's premier university. As a teenager, Nwaubani secretly dreamed of becoming a CIA or KGB agent. She earned her first income from winning a writing competition at the age of 13. Her mother is a cousin to Flora Nwapa, the first female African writer to publish a book. In her first year at University, she was a member of the Idia Hall Chess Team, and also a member of the university's (classical music) choir.

Nwaubani was one of the pioneer editorial staff of Nigeria's now defunct NEXT newspapers, established by Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Dele Olojede.

I Do Not Come to You by Chance is Nwaubani's debut novel, published in 2009. Set in the world of Nigerian email scams, the book tells the story of a young man, Kingsley, who turns to his Uncle Boniface for help in bailing his family out of poverty. In 2019, Masobe Books earned the rights to publish I Do Not Come to You by Chance in Nigeria.

Adaobi Tricia Nwaubani lives in Abuja, Nigeria, where she works as a consultant.

 Influences 
Nwaubani has expressed concern over the largely somber tone of African novels. She credits Irish-American writer Frank McCourt's Pulitzer-winning Angela's Ashes with showing her that she could write on serious issues in a humorous tone. She is also a great admirer of British humorist P. G. Wodehouse.
