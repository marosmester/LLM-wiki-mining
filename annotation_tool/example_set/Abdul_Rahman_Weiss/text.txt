 Club career 

 Youth years 
A right-back, Weiss began his career in the academy at Panathinaikos and spent the 2014–15 and 2015–16 seasons with Brentford Griffins, a community youth team of English club Brentford. He won two National League U19 Alliance titles with the team.

 Platanias 
In 2015, Weiss returned to Greece to join the academy at Platanias and progressed to sign a professional contract in February 2017. He was an unused substitute during a late-2016–17 season Super League match and broke into the team during the 2017–18 relegation season, in which he made 17 appearances. Weiss made 29 appearances and scored one goal during the 2018–19 season and was a part of the team which reached the Football League promotion playoffs. He was nominated for the Best Young Player award at the 2018–19 Football League Awards.

During a 2019–20 season affected by military service and the COVID-19 pandemic, Weiss made 16 appearances and scored one goal, before departing the club on 1 July 2020. He made 62 appearances and scored two goals during four years as a professional at the Perivolia Municipal Stadium.

 OFI 
On 8 January 2020, it was announced that Weiss had signed a pre-contract to join Super League club OFI on a four-year contract on 1 July 2020.

Weiss made just seven appearances during the first half of the 2023–24 season, before transferring to Nassaji Mazandaran in February 2024. Ultimately the transfer "could not be concluded due to procedural issues" and Weiss remained with Athens Kallithea. He made five appearances during the club's successful promotion playoff campaign and ended the 2023–24 season with 12 appearances in all competitions. Weiss was released when his contract expired and ended his 18 months at the Grigoris Lamprakis Stadium with 23 appearances and one goal.
